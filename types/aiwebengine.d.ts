 *
 * Add this reference to your scripts for IDE autocomplete and type checking:

 *
 * IMPORTANT: Every script MUST export an init() function that registers routes,
 * GraphQL resolvers, or other initialization logic.
 *
 * @example
 * // Minimal script structure
 * function myHandler(context) {
 *   return ResponseBuilder.json({ message: "Hello" });
 * }
 *
 * function init() {
 *   routeRegistry.registerRoute("/api/hello", "myHandler", "GET");
 * }

// ============================================================================
// Script Initialization
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Initialization function that must be exported by every script.
 * This function is called when the script is loaded and should register
 * routes, GraphQL resolvers, or perform other setup tasks.
 *
 * @param context - Handler context (optional, may not be provided during init)
 * @example
 * function init() {
 *   // Register HTTP routes
 *   routeRegistry.registerRoute("/api/users", "listUsers", "GET");
 *   routeRegistry.registerRoute("/api/users/:id", "getUser", "GET");
 *
 *   // Register GraphQL queries
 *   graphQLRegistry.registerQuery(
 *     "getUser",
 *     "getUser(id: ID!): User",
 *     "getUserResolver",
 *     "external",
 *   );
 *
 *   // Register streams
 *   routeRegistry.registerStreamRoute("/events/notifications");
 *
 *   // Log initialization
 *   console.log("Script initialized successfully");
 * }
 */
declare function init(context?: HandlerContext): void;

// ============================================================================
// When registration takes effect
// ============================================================================

/**
 * Every global in this file is present in every execution context. A script
 * sees the same API whether it was entered through an HTTP route, a GraphQL
 * resolver, an MCP tool, a scheduled job, a stream customizer, a message
 * listener or a test, so shared helpers never need `typeof x === "undefined"`
 * guards. What a call is *allowed* to do still depends on the caller's
 * capabilities, and what it *does* depends on the phase described here.
 *
 * A script's top-level program is re-evaluated on every invocation, and only
 * `init()` runs in the registration phase. So these methods:
 *
 * - `routeRegistry.registerRoute` / `registerAssetRoute` / `registerStreamRoute`
 * - `graphQLRegistry.registerQuery` / `registerMutation` / `registerSubscription`
 * - `mcpRegistry.registerTool` / `registerPrompt`
 * - `schedulerService.registerOnce` / `registerRecurring` / `clearAll`
 * - `dispatcher.registerListener`
 *
 * take effect during startup and `init()`, and elsewhere return a string saying
 * the entry was not registered. They never throw for being called at the wrong
 * time — a script that registers at top level rather than inside `init()` would
 * otherwise fail on every request. Argument validation is unaffected: a bad
 * path or an empty name is reported the same way in every context.
 *
 * Everything else — `database`, `assetStorage`, `secretStorage`,
 * `scriptStorage`, `personalStorage`, `fetch`, `convert`, `console`,
 * `McpClient`, `dispatcher.sendMessage`, `graphQLRegistry.executeGraphQL`,
 * `routeRegistry.sendStreamMessage` — works in every context.
 *
 * Register in `init()`. Registering from a request handler silently does
 * nothing, which is rarely what the script intended.
 */

// ============================================================================
// Limits
// ============================================================================

/**
 * What a script may spend, and how large anything it handles may be.
 *
 * Every number below is written by the engine that served this file, from the
 * limits it is actually enforcing — the same source `GET /engine/openapi.json`
 * publishes as `x-aiwebengine-limits`. A copy read from the repository rather
 * than from a running engine still carries the markers themselves, which is
 * the honest answer: several of these are configuration, and a file on disk
 * cannot know what a particular deployment chose.
 *
 * **The execution model.** These are not numbers, and they are what surprises
 * people arriving from a browser or from Node:
 *
 * {{limits.notes}}
 *
 * **Budgets.** One invocation gets `javascript.execution_timeout_ms` of wall
 * clock ({{limits.execution.timeout}}), {{limits.execution.maxMemory}} of
 * memory and a {{limits.execution.stackSize}} stack — about
 * {{limits.execution.stackFrames}} frames of recursion, past which QuickJS
 * throws an error the script can see. `init()` gets its own budget
 * (`javascript.init_timeout_ms`, {{limits.execution.initTimeout}}), because it
 * runs once per deployment rather than once per request and a script whose
 * `init()` is cut off does not serve at all. A test module gets
 * {{limits.execution.testModuleTimeout}} and a whole test run
 * {{limits.execution.testRunTimeout}}.
 *
 * The budget is enforced between JavaScript operations *and* as a ceiling on
 * each host call, so a slow database statement cannot outlive it. What it
 * cannot do is interrupt a statement already running inside Postgres: that is
 * what `repository.statement_timeout_ms`
 * ({{limits.database.statementTimeout}}), `lock_timeout_ms`
 * ({{limits.database.lockTimeout}}) and `idle_in_transaction_timeout_ms`
 * ({{limits.database.idleInTransactionTimeout}}) are for, and why
 * `database.beginTransaction(timeoutMs)` can only tighten them.
 *
 * At most `javascript.max_concurrent_executions` scripts run at once
 * ({{limits.execution.maxConcurrent}}). Past that a request waits for a slot
 * inside the timeout it already had, rather than being refused. The number is
 * sized against the connection pool rather than against the CPU: a script
 * touching the database holds a slot and a connection until it answers, so
 * slots far above the pool would only deepen the queue.
 *
 * **Sizes.** A script's root source is {{limits.size.maxScriptSource}}, one
 * asset {{limits.size.maxAsset}} with a URI of at most
 * {{limits.size.maxAssetUriChars}} characters, one `scriptStorage` /
 * `personalStorage` value {{limits.size.maxStorageValue}}, one secret
 * {{limits.size.maxSecretValue}}, a `fetch` response
 * {{limits.fetch.maxResponse}}, and `convert.markdown_to_html` /
 * `render_handlebars_template` {{limits.size.maxMarkdown}} of input each. A
 * request arriving at one of your routes is bounded by
 * `security.max_request_body_bytes` ({{limits.size.maxRequestBody}}), or by
 * `repository.max_upload_size_bytes` plus framing when it is form-encoded or
 * multipart ({{limits.size.maxUpload}}); past either, the caller gets a 413
 * and your handler is never entered. A GraphQL query executed through
 * `graphQLRegistry` is at most {{limits.graphql.maxQueryChars}} characters
 * with {{limits.graphql.maxVariablesChars}} of variables.
 *
 * **The script database.** {{limits.database.maxTablesPerScript}} tables per
 * script, {{limits.database.maxColumnsPerTable}} columns per table, and
 * identifiers of at most {{limits.database.maxIdentifierChars}} characters
 * matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`. `database.query` returns
 * {{limits.database.defaultQueryLimit}} rows when you name no limit and clamps
 * a named one to {{limits.database.maxQueryLimit}} — silently, so a query
 * wanting more has to page. The connection pool
 * ({{limits.database.maxConnections}}) is shared by every script on the
 * instance, and each call holds a connection for its whole round trip.
 *
 * **Network.** `fetch` and `McpClient` speak {{limits.fetch.schemes}} only,
 * refuse localhost and private, loopback and link-local addresses — including
 * a public host that resolves to one, at every hop — follow at most
 * {{limits.fetch.maxRedirects}} redirects within one budget, and understand
 * `{{limits.fetch.encodings}}`. Asking for `br` or `zstd` is an error rather
 * than an unreadable body. An `McpClient` naming a blocked address is refused
 * when it is constructed, before its token is looked up.
 *
 * **Scheduled jobs.** A recurring interval is at least
 * {{limits.scheduler.minRecurringInterval}} and a job name
 * 1-{{limits.scheduler.maxJobNameChars}} characters.
 *
 * **Retention.** Logs are not storage: a line survives only while it is within
 * both the newest {{limits.retention.logsKeepPerScript}} of its script and
 * {{limits.retention.logsRetentionHours}} hours of now, and either clause
 * alone removes it. Revisions are kept for
 * {{limits.retention.revisionsRetentionDays}} days *and* the newest
 * {{limits.retention.revisionsKeepPerScript}} per script — a revision has to
 * fall outside both before it goes — and a labelled revision, the newest that
 * initialised cleanly, and the newest of each script are kept regardless.
